Yesterday all my troubles seemed so far away.
Now it looks as though they're here to stay.
Oh, I believe in yesterday.</p>

<p>Suddenly I'm not half the man I used to be.
There's a shadow hanging over me.
Oh, yesterday came suddenly.</p>

<p>Why she had to go, I don't know, she wouldn't say.
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday.</p>

<p>Yesterday love was such an easy game to play.
Now I need a place to hide away.
Oh, I believe in yesterday.</p>

<p>Why she had to go, I don't know, she wouldn't say.
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday.

<p>Yesterday love was such an easy game to play.
Now I need a place to hide away.
Oh, I believe in yesterday.</p>

<p>Mm mm mm mm mm mm mm</p>
